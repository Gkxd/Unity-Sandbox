##Description
This project is a Unity implementation of the concepts explained in Inigo Quilez's [plane deformation article](http://iquilezles.org/www/articles/deform/deform.htm). All of the shaders use a texture, except "fractal" which procedurally generates a texture.

##Preview
All previews use the test texture in Assets/Images, except for "fractal" which uses a green color instead.
